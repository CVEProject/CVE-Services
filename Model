The DOM is a programming API for documents. It closely resembles the structure of the documents it models. For instance, consider this table, taken from an HTML document:


      <TABLE>
      <TBODY> 
      <TR> 
      <TD>Shady Grove</TD>
      <TD>Aeolian</TD> 
      </TR> 
      <TR>
      <TD>Over the River, Charlie</TD>        
      <TD>Dorian</TD> 
      </TR> 
      </TBODY>
      </TABLE>
