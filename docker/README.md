# Using Docker with CVE Services

## Security Considerations

>**Warning**
>
>DO NOT use the dev configuration on a public network. The dev environment includes credentials to enable rapid development, and the MongoDB service config does not include authentication. This is not secure for public deployment.

## Local Development and Testing

The following builds and runs cve-services (Node.js app and Mongo) in Docker containers. The included example configurations run the services in `dev` or `int` mode.

>**Note**
>
> These commands must be run from the `docker/` directory.

### Environments

See the `.docker-env.example` and `.docker-env.int-example` files for examples of required environment variables. For development environments, it's important to define the following:

```
LOCAL_KEY=XXXXXXX-XXXXXXX-XXXXXXX-XXXXXXX
NODE_ENV=development
```

When using a development environment, the `LOCAL_KEY` is the API token key for the secretariat. In integration environments, the API keys will be written to a file named `user-secret.txt` in the project directory after database population.

### Start Docker Containers

```bash
cd docker/
git switch <branchname>

# use the integration environment
cp .docker-env.int-example .docker-env
docker compose up --build
```

>**Note**
>
> Use branch name `int` for penetration testing, and `dev` for local development.

Docker will build or update the containers if needed. In a few minutes, you should see something similar to the following:

```

```

### Pre-load Data

Populate mongoDB with test data included in `datadump/pre-population/`

Run the command below using `populate:dev` or `populate:int` depending on your environment:
```
docker-compose exec cveawg npm run populate:int
```

You should see the following:
```
> cve-services@0.0.3 populate:dev /app
> NODE_ENV=development node-dev src/scripts/populate.js

2022-06-07 19:58:32 [info]: "Using NODE_ENV 'development' and app environment 'development'"
2022-06-07 19:58:32 [info]: "Using dbName = cve_dev"
2022-06-07 19:58:32 [info]: "Will try to connect to database cve_dev at docdb:27017"
2022-06-07 19:58:32 [info]: "Successfully connected to database!"
Are you sure you wish to pre-populate the database for the development environment? Doing so will drop the Cve, Cve-Id-Range, Cve-Id, User, Org collection(s) in the cve_dev database. (y/n) y

2022-06-07 19:58:37 [info]: "Populating Org collection..."
2022-06-07 19:58:37 [info]: "Org populated!"
2022-06-07 19:58:37 [info]: "Populating User collection..."
2022-06-07 19:58:38 [info]: "User populated!"
2022-06-07 19:58:38 [info]: "Populating Cve-Id-Range collection..."
2022-06-07 19:58:38 [info]: "Populating Cve collection..."
2022-06-07 19:58:38 [info]: "Populating Cve-Id collection..."
2022-06-07 19:58:38 [info]: "Cve-Id-Range populated!"
2022-06-07 19:58:38 [info]: "Cve populated!"
2022-06-07 19:58:39 [info]: "Cve-Id populated!"
2022-06-07 19:58:39 [info]: "Successfully populated the database!"

```

### Display the API key

The API token key is generated or stored differently depending on the value of the `NODE_ENV` environment variable.

#### Integration

For `integration` Node environments, the API key will be generate and saved to the `user-secret.txt` file when the database is populated.

Display the key with:

`docker-compose exec cveawg grep admin2 user-secret.txt`

#### Development

In `development` environments, the API is the value of the `LOCAL_KEY` variable in the `docker.env` file.

You can view the value for the running container with:

`docker-compose exec cveawg env | grep LOCAL_KEY`

### Use Curl to Test

#### Create a curl config file (recommended)

Create a curl config file in `$HOME/.curl-cve-config` similar to the following, where each line is a curl argument. In dev environments, use the value of the `LOCAL_KEY` environment variable (also output when pre-populating) as the API key.

```
-H "CVE-API-ORG: mitre"
-H "CVE-API-USER: admin2@mitre.org"
-H "CVE-API-KEY: XXXXXXX-XXXXXXX-XXXXXXX-XXXXXXX"
-H "Content-type: application/json"
-s
-S
```

#### Use curl to test the API endpoints

See the [API documentation](https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-services#api-documentation) for available endpoints.

  * Show CVE IDs:
  `curl -K ~/.curl-cve-config http://localhost:3000/api/cve-id`

  * Retrieve organization info (Secretariat only. Use appropriate credentials in curl config file):
  `curl -K ~/.curl-cve-config http://localhost:3000/api/org`

  * Add a CNA (Secretariat only. Use appropriate credentials in curl config file):
    `curl -K ~/.curl-cve-config -X POST \
      --data-binary '{"name": "Example Corporation","short_name": "exampleCorp"}' \
      http://localhost:3000/api/org`


>**Note**
>
>Each command returns unformatted JSON. Piping through a formatter like [JQ](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) makes it easier to read: `curl -K ~/.curl-cve-config http://localhost:3000/api/cve-id | jq .`

## To shell into the web app server

  `docker compose exec cveawg /bin/sh`

## Mongo DB

The `docker-compose.yml` file exposes the default Mongo port to the host: `localhost:27017`. You can connect using any Mongo viewer such as [Mongo Express](https://github.com/mongo-express/mongo-express) or [Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass) on the host.
